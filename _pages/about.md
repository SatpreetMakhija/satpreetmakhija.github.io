Hola! Welcome to my digital garden. I'm a software engineer at Google in the [Google Distributed Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud) team.

I care deeply about software systems and how they can be used to solve problems. When I'm not building software, I can be found wandering the streets with my DSLR, reading books or stretching my writing skills.

See select pictures [here](/blog/2025/gallery). Read my latest piece on over-stimulation [here](/blog/2025/the-messiah-of-empty-highs). You can always find my reading list [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/116660458-satpreet?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read).

I enjoy making friends online who share similar interests. Don't hesitate to reach out at `work.<MY_FIRST_NAME>@gmail.com`.
