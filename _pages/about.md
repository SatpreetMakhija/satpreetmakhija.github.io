Hey, thanks for visiting my site.
<br>
<br>

  I'm Satpreet. I see the world through a computational lens—a perspective that's served
  me well across domains. I've worked on distributed systems, building platforms,
  infrastructure, and backend systems, most notably at [Google's Distributed
  Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud) team. I care deeply about
  abstractions because they're not just tools but the very medium through which we solve
  problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  I'm a voracious reader and enjoy writing (read my latest
  [piece](/blog/2025/the-messiah-of-empty-highs)). You can tell a lot about a person from
   their reading list—here's [mine](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/116660458-satpr
  eet?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read).
<br>

The easiest way to reach out to me is via email: work[dot]satpreet[at]gmail[dot]com.
