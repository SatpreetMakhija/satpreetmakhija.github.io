Hey, thanks for visiting my site.
<br>
<br>
I'm Satpreet. I enjoy working on distributed infrastructure and backend problems, most of which I learnt at Google working as a Software Engineer in their [Distributed Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud) team. If you've got such problems, I'm your guy. I care deeply about my craft and am a sucker for good abstractions. Whenever I get a chance, I'm improving my Neovim configs.
<br>
<br>
My free time is mostly spent on photography (see my [portfolio](https://portfolio.satpreetmakhija.com)) and writing (read my latest [piece](/blog/2025/the-messiah-of-empty-highs)). You can tell a lot about a person from their reading list. Here's [mine](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/116660458-satpreet?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read).

The easiest way to reach out to me is via email: work[dot]satpreet[at]gmail[dot]com.
